#### Why Create This?

I've been playing fantasy football since 2013. The very first player I ever drafted, ever, was Tom Brady. I had largely finished my hiatus from the NFL after watching my beloved Bills flounder for a decade. Drafting a QB early was not a good move, but it did highlight the need for succinct and easy to digest "soundbites" for almost any fantasy team manager out there. 

Granted, I did try to do some last-minute research before drafting - but most of the articles were written as if I knew who all these players were. Things like [beersheets](https://footballabsurdity.com/beersheet-request-form/) largely didn't exist or I could not find them. There were some good resources back then, but they required a lot of background knowledge of the game of football and required a large time investment.

Today, we have the opposite problem. So many resources and people telling you opposite things, it is difficult to know what to believe. Twitter will tell you every approach is both right and wrong at the same time. As I write this in 2022, the Bestball format has reached a fever pitch that seems to eschew strategy altogether in favor of purely playing the numbers game. One might enter so many drafts that they can cover as many permutations of "level" player exposure so as to give themselves the best chances of hitting. This requires them to draft hundreds if not thousands of teams. 

So then instead, I'd like to try and distill down some of the best minds and writers in the fantasy realm into one-sentence or one-concept lines. You could potentially glean all of the information you needed to know within several seconds instead of spending 34 minutes on a podcast or 15+ mins reading an article that may or may not be behind a paywall. (this is not a negative - these guys put a LOT of work into this and they deserve to get paid too).
